            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seatbelts and grab a slice of cake! I'm Cindy, a curriculum designer by day, cake-baking aficionado by night, and an avid audiobook listener during the commute. My journey began at Brigham Young University, where I majored in Physics Teaching and minored in Mathematics. I have a deep-rooted love for numbers and equations, which led me to teach math for a decade. Not stopping there, I pursued a master’s degree in Educational Technology from Boise State, fueling my passion for integrating technology into education.</p>

            <p>I blend technology with creativity, sprinkle in a dash of 50's rock 'n' roll, and top it all off with a passion for camping under the stars. When I’m not whipping up engaging curriculums, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, tuning into the latest audiobooks, or perfecting a new cake recipe. I’m a lifelong learner who loves delving into the science of learning, especially in the realm of online education.</p>
                
            <p>Today, I invite you to join me on this sweet journey through our class, where we’ll explore innovative ways to blend education and technology, making learning an exciting adventure. So, get comfortable, because we’re about to embark on an engaging and informative ride together! </p>

            <p>Idaho is a state in the US located north of Utah. It has diverse landscapes with lakes, rivers, forests, and mountain ranges. It is known as the gem state, which was a way to get prospectors to come to this state, it doesn't actually have a lot of gems here. Idaho is growing quickly in population now, especially the capital city, Boise. Idaho is know for its potato production.</p>
